## McDonald's Urban Legends: Fact or Fiction?

McDonald's, the fast-food giant, has found itself at the center of numerous urban legends over the years. From sinister accusations to far-fetched claims about its ingredients, the company has vehemently denied many of these stories.

**IRA Funding Rumors**

"In the late 1980s, rumors persisted in the United Kingdom that McDonald's was covertly funding the Provisional IRA, which was designated as a terror organization." These rumors were eventually traced to a CNN talk show in which the company was praised for its generous employee retirement plans.

**Questionable Meat Sources**

Another persistent claim is that McDonald's buys its meat from a nonexistent company called "100% Beef," allowing it to label its burgers as such despite containing soy and other by-products. However, "McDonald's has stated that this story is an urban legend."

**Cow Eyeball Burgers**

"One belief is that McDonald's uses cow eyeballs in its products, permitting it to brand them as '100% beef.'" However, the USDA requires proper labeling of all beef by-products, including cow eyeballs.

**Cheeseburger Conundrum**

"One story claims that if McDonald's cheeseburgers did not include pickles as an ingredient, the cheeseburger would be classed as a confectionery item." This stems from the belief that the bun contains high sugar content, but the pickles keep the overall percentage below the classification threshold. Again, McDonald's dismisses this as an urban legend.

**Final Thoughts**

Many of the urban legends surrounding McDonald's have been debunked. While some may have a kernel of truth or have been misrepresented over time, the company's consistent denials and the lack of credible evidence suggest that most of these claims should be taken with a grain of salt.
