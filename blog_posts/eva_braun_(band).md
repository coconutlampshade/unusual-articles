## Eva Braun: The Band That Rocked Vojvodina

From the small town of Bečej in Serbia emerged Eva Braun, a pop-rock band that ignited the music scene of the 1990s.

"The name of the band, Eva Braun, was proposed by Vasović after viewing a biographical film about Adolf Hitler. The name was both unusual and provocative, which was agreeable to the other members."

Formed in 1990, Eva Braun's debut album "Prisluškivanja" (Eavesdroppings) dropped in 1992, boasting a blend of original tracks and covers of iconic bands like The Beatles and Idoli. Their unique sound and poetic lyrics made them stand out.

"The debut album... was recorded between February and April 1992 in the 'Do Re Mi' studio in Bukovac near Novi Sad... The recording lasted for about 130 hours on the 8-channel Magnetophon, using rhythm machine instead of drums."

Eva Braun's music sparked a pop-rock revival in the region, influencing numerous bands that followed. They became a staple in the Vojvodina music scene and left a lasting impact on Serbian pop culture.
